Code book

The original description files activity_labels.txt, features.txt are loaded and column names assigned.

The subject assignment files subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt are loaded from the train and test directories. Column names are assigned.

The training and test data description files y_train.txt and y_test.txt (are loaded from the train and test directories. Matching activity labels are appended to both files as well as the respective subject identifiers. 

The data files X_train.txt and X_test.txt are loaded. Feature labels are assigned as column names. 
The number of variables is reduced by extracting the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. This step reduces the number of variables from 561 in the original dataset to 79. All other variables from the original study are omitted.
Subject and activity information is added to the training and test datasets.
For future reference both datasets are amended with a flag indicating their use in the original study in the training or test data sets.

Training and test datasets are merged into X_combined.

In a final step a new tidy dataset (subj_activity_avg) is created with the average for each activity and each subject for each of the 79 variables.
Variables are labed by prefixing "avg_". Hyphens ("-") are replaced by underscores ("_") and opening and closing brackets are removed from the variable names.

The dataset is saved to subj_activity_avg.txt.
